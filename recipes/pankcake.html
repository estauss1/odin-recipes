        <p>Delicious and simple vegan pancakes that the entire family will love!</p>
        <h3 class="i-title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingred">
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="s-title">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="step">
            <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; 
                make a well in the center. Whisk together water and oil 
                in a small bowl; pour into flour mixture. Stir just until 
                blended; mixture will be lumpy.
            </li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until 
                bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until 
                bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.
            </li>
        </ol>
